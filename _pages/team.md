## Stephen Beard - Founder 
<img src="/images/Wedding Pic3.jpg" align="left" alt="Stephen Beard" width="30%" height = "auto" hspace = "10"> Stephen is a chartered accountant and currently works as the Financial Director for one of the UK's largest online alcohol retailers. The day to day realities of running a business of size quickly caused Stephen to grow interested in economics, and the more he read the more he questioned. After self studying several mainstream undergraduate level macroeconomic text books, the discrepancy between theory and lived reality only became larger.
Stephen's study has always focused on attempting to boil down complex theories into their core underlying assumptions, and mainstream economics is built on assumptions that are disprovably wrong. Whether it's the idea that all people are perfectly rational, that all factors of production are always at full capacity or the concept that major invevstment decisions are almost solely influenced by the interest rate - the list of core assumptions that fail both empirical and common sense tests in mainstream economics is long and alarming. 
In a search for understanding he self-studied text books from a variety of heterodox (non-mainstream) branches of economics, and began to find real insight in these marginalised areas of research. Some of these theories took their starting point from central banking regulation and balance of trade accounting, topics which are non controversial in themselves, but which are at odds with key assumptions in mainstream economics.
