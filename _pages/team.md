## Stephen Beard - Founder 

<img src="/images/Wedding Pic3.jpg" align="left" alt="Stephen Beard" width="30%" height = "auto" hspace = "10"> Stephen is a chartered accountant and currently works as the Financial Director for one of the UK's largest online alcohol retailers. The day-to-day realities of running a business of size quickly caused Stephen to grow interested in economics, and the more he read the more he questioned. After self-studying several mainstream undergraduate level macroeconomic textbooks, the discrepancy between theory and lived reality only became larger.

Stephen's study has always focused on attempting to boil down complex theories into their core underlying assumptions, and mainstream economics is built on assumptions that are easily disprovable. Whether it's the idea that all people are perfectly rational, that all factors of production are always at full capacity or the concept that major investment decisions are almost solely influenced by the interest rate - the list of core assumptions that fail both empirical and common-sense tests in mainstream economics is long and alarming. 

In a search for understanding he self-studied textbooks from a variety of heterodox (non-mainstream) branches of economics and began to find real insight in these marginalised areas of research. Some of these theories took their starting point from central banking regulation and balance of trade accounting, topics which are non-controversial in themselves, but which are at odds with key assumptions in mainstream economics. 

After considering pursuing a PhD in Economics, he decided that the extremely narrow focus of such a research form made little sense when economics had such large fundamental unanswered questions. Instead Stephen has pursued his own program of self-study and learning for interest rather than work. The next obvious evolution was to begin to build economic models, as the only logical way to test theories was to model them and compare them with historical data. Doing this well would clearly require computer programming skills, good sources of macroeconomic data and a very well thought out methodology. He had none of these things but was excited to learn!

From there the project has developed into a very basic global economic model which incorporates AI, modular software design and a clear methodology. He recognises that this is in truth just a personal project, but asks a very simple question, in what other aspect of life would one person attempt to tackle a project requiring so many different skills? In business there would be an organised team of specialists who's in depth knowledge would make their output far greater than the sum of their parts. Economic theories are hugely important, therefore they need to be right, therefore they need to be tested, therefore they need to be modelled, therefore there is a need for something like Lantern Economics.
